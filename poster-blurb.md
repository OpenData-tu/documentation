The OpenData platform is a cloud-based system that provides a home for the new wave of environmental data coming from IoT devices, a place where sensor enthusiasts and organizations alike can donate their data. Such a platform creates value by providing data scientists a common querying interface for different datasets and to layer them in new, exciting and unexpected ways. The prototype aims to provide properties of high availability, fault tolerance and throughput which are essential design and architectural considerations on modern systems dealing with very large data volumes.
