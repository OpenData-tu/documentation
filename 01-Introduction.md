## Summary/Overview/Abstract


## What is Open Data

So what do we mean when we talk about "open data"?

> Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).
http://opendefinition.org/

Further, the definition encompasses the following aspects:

> * **Availability and Access**: the data must be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably by downloading over the Internet. The data must also be available in a convenient and modifiable form.
* **Re-use and Redistribution**: the data must be provided under terms that permit re-use and redistribution including the intermixing with other datasets.
* **Universal Participation**: everyone must be able to use, re-use and redistribute - there should be no discrimination against fields of endeavour or against persons or groups. For example, ‘non-commercial’ restrictions that would prevent ‘commercial’ use, or restrictions of use for certain purposes (e.g. only in education), are not allowed.

### Time series data & non-static sensor environmental data

So how does this "open data" differ from the data we're interested in? The simple answer is the lack of the time dimension in existing data. The large majority of open data out there today is static. Environmental data are usually represented on discrete "datasets", but there is no connection between data of the same source or type which was collected at different times. For example, one might find a dataset about a particular environmental measurement such as average and maximum water pollution on a given set of geographical areas or points. However, the same data for the following month or year are published separately, with no connection to the first, and at times having different formats or semantics.

We therefore distinguish between static data of the type described above (of which there is an abundance) to the data which are in scope for the project, namely time series data of environmental measurements coming from a device (i.e. a sensor or sensor network) with some form of geo-information. For example, an array of air pollution sensors in a given city may collect data every at 15-minute intervals; this would be represented as individual records containing the timestamp, the sensor's geolocation and the air pollution measurement.


## Motivation

*Open data* efforts in the past have focused on providing a centralized platform onto which data producers can upload their data along with some metadata but without much (if any) concern for the schema or the format in which the data is offered. This has resulted in very large independent and heterogeneous catalogs of data which are difficult to discover and integrate without significant manual effort.

The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has also meant that unprecedented amounts of data are generated by millions of devices every second of every day. However, devices generates data in their own (often closed-source proprietary) format, thanks to a lack of a common or widely established data model for environmental data. This results in lots of data from which it's difficult to gain insights due to the inherent difficulty in querying data in disparate representations.

Also, as the price of devices declines, more and more enthusiasts are willing to share their data to open communities so that it can be used and queried by anyone. To tackle these challenges our project centers around building a prototype which provides:

* a platform on which data owners can share their sensor-generated environmental data,
* a unified schema to support queries across different data from heterogeneous sources
* a simple and extensible framework to facilitate the data import process,
* and a flexible querying interface for accessing the data.

With this we aim to create a tool that generates economic and social value through new and creative "layering" of data.

`//TODO` there is very little background to talk about specific stuff in the req's (like units & measurements if those concepts haven't been introduced. Move the decomposition & req's further down & pull up the open-data & other introductory text about our domain here)


### Decomposition

The problem domain can be decomposed into the following components:

1. Data Import Framework
1. Database
1. Public API
1. Cloud Infrastructure


## Requirements

The above objectives translate into the following requirements:


### General

1. **Open Source Software**: Libraries & components used shall be open source software.
1. **Cloud architectural style**: Guiding architectural principle shall be to avoid monolith-style applications, but rather include cloud concerns from early on (i.e. design phase).
1. **Scalability**: Components shall be inherently scalable.
1. **Fault tolerance**: Components shall provide fault tolerance capabilities.
1. **Performance**: The system (and its constituent components) shall have the ability to handle extremely high demand.
1. **Portability**: The system shall be deployable both on public and private clouds.


### Data Import Framework

1. Provide facilities for common access patterns of data sources (e.g. FTP, HTTP)
1. Provide facilities to read data in common formats (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML)
1. Provide facilities to map the user schema to the platforms common schema
1. Provide reusable community-based unit converters


### Database

1. Ability to perform time series and geolocation range queries


### Public API

`TODO` prob just the Scalability & fault tolerance concerns already mentioned under General, so not sure what reqs we had for the API individually (if any)...

1. RESTful
    * Stateless
