# Project Management & Organization

The main challenge of project management is to achieve specific results within a given scope, time, quality and budget. At the end of every successful project, there will be a unique product meeting the specified requirements. This chapter will elaborate on the development process, the chosen approach and the available resources. The resources that this chapter will focus on are the diverse team and limited budget.

## The Team

The team for this project was formed of 7 master's students majoring in computer science, computer engineering and information systems management. Besides having different areas of specialization, the team consisted of four nationalities with English as the language for main communication. This led to ...
In addition, the amount of professional experience was highly disparate among the team members which caused ...

## Development Process & Approach

To best tackle the given requirements and challenges, we decided for an agile process. To be more specific, we used a stripped-down Scrum approach.

In our approach, the distinction between the different roles was not very strict. Every team member held simultaneously the role of a product owner and developer for his specific building block of the global architecture. The same is applicable for the Scrum master. This role was mainly held by the project manager, though the whole team was encouraged to ensure an agile process. Further, the workflow was adapted to our specific flow of work so that we convened a sprint meeting weekly with an additional interim meeting and omitted a daily scrum.

We used Trello to keep track of our issues. Trello was organized into four main columns that represented the lifecycle of an issue. Namely, an issue was created in the product backlog that was populated as the project advanced. The next step was the current sprint, which was followed by issues that were currently worked on. The lifecycle finished when issues were ready to be verified and finally marked as done. To communicate between the meetings, we used Slack with several channels to create an useful separation of topics discussed. Additionally, a shared calendar helped to remember important dates and deadlines. Besides that, versioned documents on Google Drive were used to store notes and document the meetings and decisions. Finally, we used Github for source control and as a repository for the code that was written during the project.

In order to intergrate the tools we used as well as to automate workflows a service called Zapier was used. We used it to receive notifications about changes on Github and Google Drive and progress on the Trello board. Though, after the trial ended the functionality was limited so that only notifications about Github updates were send.

## Constraints

Like every other project, this one was as well subject to several constraints. The very nature of a project makes it a temporary endeavor. Thus, product had to be finishes in elven weeks starting on April, 27 and ending on July, 30. In addition, at half-time an interim meeting was hold on June, 1. During this 11 weeks three feedback sessions were hold - one before the interim meeting and two after.

Moreover, monetary constraints added a level of difficulty. While developing software consisting of several disparate building blocks, it is crucial to deploy and test the components stand-alone and in ensemble. The only feasible way to conduct such testing is to use a cloud provider. Due to the fact that we had no budget to spend on cloud services, we used the student grant of 100$ that Amazon Webservices (AWS) offers. Here, the challenge was to receive access to the student grant and be able to use all the services provided.

Further, the budget constraints forced us to start and terminate the whole infrastructure every time a test was conducted. In other words, a significant amount of time was necessary to create the test environment every time, which was hard to compensate in the already strict time limit.

## Concluding Remarks

In conclusion, we used a Scrum based approach throughout 11 weeks of project work. Despite...
