# documentation

This repo is inteded for documenting project-wide topics that do not belong to a specific repo. The final project documentation deliverable will be generated from the contents of this repo.

## Guidelines

Content which is intended to be included in the final documentation deliverable should be included as a markdown file in this repository. Each file represents a section of the final document, so be cognizant of splitting up work in reasonable sections. Also, partition the work into smaller files in cases where you're going to be collaborating with someone else (unless you really enjoy merging). All changes must be documented (see [editing](#editing)).

Development-only documentation should go in the [wiki](https://github.com/OpenData-tu/documentation/wiki).

## Editing

Every document must begin with a version summary, which states **who** added **what** (e.g. which section) **when**.

The following template is proposed:

**Created by:**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Smith  
**Date created:**&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-01
