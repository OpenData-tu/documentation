# documentation

This repo is used for documenting project-wide topics, that do not belong to a specific repo

Maybe this will be moved to another place, if the chair is not ok with us using a github-wiki, but markdown files can go here till then.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/OpenData-tu/documentation/wiki) for the content.
